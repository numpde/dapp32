# dapp32

Dapp32 is a web app for displaying custom user interfaces similar to a blockchain explorer 
and for facilitating user-initiated, gasless blockchain transactions.

On-chain contracts supply these custom interfaces and can fund transaction fees, 
bypassing the need 
for developers to maintain separate servers and
for users to own cryptocurrency.

For an example, see
